## Local Setup

YourStorage! relies on Appwrite for authentication, database, and file storage. Since the Appwrite instance is tied to a specific account, running the project locally requires setting up your own Appwrite backend.

If you want to modify and run YourStorage! locally, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- Your own Appwrite instance (self-hosted or cloud)

### Steps
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Lucascordovaa/yourstorage_app.git
   cd yourstorage_app
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
3. Set up your Appwrite instance:
   - Create a new Appwrite project.
   - Set up authentication, a database, and a file storage bucket.
   - Obtain your project credentials.
4. Create a `.env.local` file and add your Appwrite credentials:
   ```sh
   NEXT_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
   NEXT_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_ENDPOINT=your_appwrite_endpoint
   NEXT_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_DATABASE_ID=your_database_id
   NEXT_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_BUCKET_ID=your_bucket_id
   ```
5. Run the development server:
   ```sh
   npm run dev
   ```
6. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

**Note:** Without an Appwrite setup, the application will not function locally.
